# Product Requirements Document: Series Implementation for Film Recommendations

## Project Overview
Implement a comprehensive TV series feature that mirrors the existing movie functionality in the Film Recommendations application. The series feature should provide identical functionality to movies with a seamless toggle interface.

## Objectives
- Create a complete series implementation that mirrors movie functionality
- Implement a toggle switch between Movies and Series views
- Maintain consistent user experience across both content types
- Ensure scalable architecture for future enhancements

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Implementation
- Create Series database models (SeriesDbM) mirroring movie structure
- Implement Series repository pattern (ISeriesRepo, SeriesRepo)
- Create Series DTOs (SeriesGetDto, SeriesCUDDto, SeriesDetails, etc.)
- Develop SeriesController with full CRUD operations
- Add Series extension methods
- Integrate TMDB TV API for series data

### Database Schema
- Create Series table with fields: SeriesId, Title, TMDbId, Liked, UserId
- Implement proper relationships and constraints
- Add migration scripts for database updates
- Ensure data integrity and foreign key relationships

### Frontend Implementation
- Create series-details.html page mirroring movie-details.html
- Implement series-details-script.js for series-specific functionality
- Create series-buttons-actions.js for series interactions
- Develop toggle component for switching between Movies/Series
- Update navigation and routing to support series pages

### UI/UX Components
- Implement toggle switch using best practices from research
- Use MagicUI components for enhanced user experience
- Ensure responsive design across all devices
- Maintain consistent styling with existing movie pages

### API Integration
- Integrate TMDB TV series endpoints
- Handle series-specific data (seasons, episodes, etc.)
- Implement series search functionality
- Add series recommendations feature

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- Write unit tests for new repositories and controllers
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Test frontend functionality across browsers
- Validate TMDB API integration
- Performance testing for new features

## User Stories

### As a user, I want to:
1. Switch between Movies and Series using an intuitive toggle
2. Browse series with the same interface as movies
3. Add series to my watchlist
4. Like/dislike series
5. View detailed series information including cast and trailers
6. Search for specific series
7. Get series recommendations

### As a developer, I need to:
1. Maintain clean architecture with separated concerns
2. Ensure code reusability between movies and series
3. Implement proper error handling and logging
4. Follow existing coding standards and patterns
5. Create comprehensive documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Toggle Implementation
- Toggle switch clearly indicates current view (Movies/Series)
- Smooth transition between views
- Maintains user's current position/filters when switching
- Follows accessibility guidelines

### Series Functionality
- All movie features available for series
- Series details page shows seasons, episodes, cast, trailers
- Proper TMDB integration for series data
- Database operations work correctly

### Performance
- Page load times remain under 3 seconds
- Toggle switching is instantaneous
- API calls are optimized and cached when appropriate

### User Experience
- Consistent styling and behavior with movie pages
- Mobile-responsive design
- Intuitive navigation and controls
- Proper error messaging

## Technical Constraints
- Must use existing technology stack (.NET, Entity Framework, Vanilla JS)
- Maintain compatibility with existing authentication system
- Follow current project structure and naming conventions
- Use TMDB API for series data

## Success Metrics
- Feature parity with movie functionality
- User engagement with series features
- Performance benchmarks met
- Zero critical bugs in production
- Positive user feedback on toggle interface

## Timeline Considerations
- Backend implementation: High priority
- Frontend toggle component: High priority  
- Series details page: Medium priority
- Advanced features (recommendations): Low priority

## Dependencies
- TMDB API documentation and rate limits
- Database migration coordination
- Frontend framework limitations
- MagicUI component availability
