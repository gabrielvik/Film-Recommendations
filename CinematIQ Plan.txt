# CinematIQ Development Plan & Workflow

## Project Overview
CinematIQ is a modern movie discovery and recommendation platform built with React 19, featuring personalized recommendations, advanced search, and user profile management using cutting-edge architecture patterns.

## Workflow Instructions

### 1. Task Management Process
- **One card per chat session** - Complete each Trello card fully before moving to next
- **Sequential dependency handling** - Respect task dependencies (e.g., FE-002 depends on FE-001)
- **Move cards through stages**: To Do → Doing → Testing → Done
- **Always test completion** - Verify each feature works independently and integrates with previous work
- **Commit after card completion** - After moving any card to "Done", immediately commit all changes with the card name as the commit message (e.g., "Complete [FE-001] Project Foundation & Tooling Setup")
- **Update plan after each card** - Document progress, next steps, and any new discoveries

### 2. Development Standards
- **Use MCP Tool Chainer** for all multi-step operations
- **Test everything** - Each feature must be verified working before marking complete
- **Maintain backward compatibility** - New features shouldn't break existing functionality
- **Follow React best practices** - Hooks, functional components, proper state management
- **Use Tailwind CSS** for styling consistency

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Run development server and verify UI/UX
- Test responsive design on multiple screen sizes
- Verify all interactive elements function correctly
- Check browser console for errors
- Validate form inputs and error handling

### 🚨 4. CRITICAL: Plan Update Protocol
- **NEVER REMOVE IMPORTANT INFORMATION** - Always preserve:
  ✅ Completed card details and outcomes
  ✅ Technical decisions and architecture notes
  ✅ Issue resolutions and discoveries
  ✅ File locations and project structure details
  ✅ Test results and verification steps
- **APPEND ONLY POLICY** - Add new info, don't delete existing
- **PRESERVE HISTORY** - Keep all completion records and technical notes
- **MAINTAIN CONTEXT** - Ensure future sessions can understand what was done

- **Commit after each card completion** ✅ - Use descriptive commit message with card name
- **Document decisions** ✅ and architectural choices

## Issues & Blockers

### Resolved Issues ✅
- **Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS Issue**: Resolved by downgrading to Tailwind CSS v3 for stability
- **ESLint Configuration**: Fixed TypeScript ESLint config compatibility issues
- **React 19 Import**: Removed unnecessary React import (auto-import JSX in React 19)
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Resolved by careful package installation order
- **TypeScript Path Mapping**: Configured @ alias in both Vite and TypeScript
- **Node.js Types**: Added @types/node for build compatibility

### Current Issues
None - Clean state ready for next task

## Notes & Discoveries

### Technical Insights from FE-001 ✅
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Still has PostCSS compatibility issues - stick with v3 for production
- **React 19**: No longer requires React import for JSX (automatic transformation)
- **Vite 6.3.5**: Excellent performance with 500ms+ build times
- **ESLint 9**: New flat config format requires careful plugin configuration
- **Port Management**: Vite auto-selects available ports (5173 → 5174)

### Technical Insights from FE-002 ✅ NEW
- **Bulletproof Architecture**: Successfully implemented with 15+ configuration files
- **Absolute Imports**: @ alias working perfectly in both development and build
- **ESLint Boundaries**: Architectural rules enforcing import restrictions
- **TypeScript Strict**: All compilation errors resolved, strict mode active
- **Folder Structure**: Complete bulletproof-react pattern implemented
- **Development Server**: Now running on port 3002 (auto-selected)
- **Performance**: Build time consistently under 1 second
- **Documentation**: ARCHITECTURE.md created for future reference

### Best Practices Established ✅
- Use `/d` flag for Windows cd commands in MCP chains
- Install base dependencies first, then add complexity
- Test build process early to catch configuration issues
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Verify all tooling integration before marking complete
- Always update plan immediately after task completion
- Preserve all technical decisions and discoveries in plan
- Create documentation files for complex architecture setups

## Technical Setup ✅ FULLY COMPLETE
