# CinematIQ Development Plan & Workflow

## Project Overview
CinematIQ is a modern movie discovery and recommendation platform built with React 19, featuring personalized recommendations, advanced search, and user profile management using cutting-edge architecture patterns.

## Workflow Instructions

### 1. Task Management Process
- **One card per chat session** - Complete each Trello card fully before moving to next
- **Sequential dependency handling** - Respect task dependencies (e.g., FE-002 depends on FE-001)
- **Move cards through stages**: To Do → Doing → Testing → Done
- **Always test completion** - Verify each feature works independently and integrates with previous work
- **Commit after card completion** - After moving any card to "Done", immediately commit all changes with the card name as the commit message (e.g., "Complete [FE-001] Project Foundation & Tooling Setup")
- **Update plan after each card** - Document progress, next steps, and any new discoveries

### 2. Development Standards
- **Use MCP Tool Chainer** for all multi-step operations
- **Test everything** - Each feature must be verified working before marking complete
- **Maintain backward compatibility** - New features shouldn't break existing functionality
- **Follow React best practices** - Hooks, functional components, proper state management
- **Use Tailwind CSS** for styling consistency

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Run development server and verify UI/UX
- Test responsive design on multiple screen sizes
- Verify all interactive elements function correctly
- Check browser console for errors
- Validate form inputs and error handling

### 🚨 4. CRITICAL: Plan Update Protocol
- **NEVER REMOVE IMPORTANT INFORMATION** - Always preserve:
  ✅ Completed card details and outcomes
  ✅ Technical decisions and architecture notes
  ✅ Issue resolutions and discoveries
  ✅ File locations and project structure details
  ✅ Test results and verification steps
- **APPEND ONLY POLICY** - Add new info, don't delete existing
- **PRESERVE HISTORY** - Keep all completion records and technical notes
- **MAINTAIN CONTEXT** - Ensure future sessions can understand what was done
